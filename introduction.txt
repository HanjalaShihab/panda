pandas is a python library used for working with data sets



ðŸ”¹ 1. Data Loading
Pandas can read data from various sources (CSV, Excel, SQL, JSON, etc.) using pd.read_csv(), read_excel(), etc.

This helps you quickly bring real-world data into your ML pipeline.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Data Cleaning
Real-world data is messy. Pandas helps with:

Handling missing values (df.isnull(), df.fillna(), df.dropna())

Removing duplicates

Type conversions (e.g., astype())

ðŸ”¹ 3. Data Exploration and Analysis
Use functions like df.describe(), df.info(), df.groupby(), etc., to understand the data.

This step helps in feature engineering and understanding what model to use.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Feature Engineering
Create or transform features using:

Column operations (e.g., df['new_col'] = df['col1'] * df['col2'])

One-hot encoding (pd.get_dummies())

Binning, scaling, or normalizing data

ðŸ”¹ 5. Data Selection and Filtering
Easily slice, filter, and query data using Pandasâ€™ intuitive syntax (loc, iloc, boolean indexing).

Helps in selecting training and test sets, or filtering out outliers.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Integration with ML Libraries
Pandas DataFrames and Series are compatible with scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow, etc.

Most ML models in Python accept NumPy arrays or Pandas DataFrames as input.
